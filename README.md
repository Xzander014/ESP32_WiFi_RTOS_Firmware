# ESP32_WiFi_RTOS_Firmware
A dual-core ESP32 firmware using ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS, separating networking and application tasks across two cores for improved working. • Implemented inter-task communication using FreeRTOS queues and mutexes to safely process HTTP-driven commands. • Added Wi-Fi auto-reconnect and persistent configuration storage using NVS flash memory.
